## 🚀 Introduction

**TrendSpotter** is a distributed system designed for the real-time identification of **emerging trends** and for building a data structure that **enables personalized recommendations**. Inspired by dynamic platforms such as Twitter Trends and Google News, the system orchestrates a powerful Big Data stack: from continuous data stream ingestion (simulated via Kafka), to advanced semantic text analysis (with Sentence Embeddings), to intelligent clustering (optimized KMeans) for topic discovery, and finally to graph construction in Neo4j.

This project goes beyond basic data processing by creating a relational data structure that supports recommendation systems, demonstrating how the synergy of Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, and Neo4j can bring intelligent and dynamic information systems to life.

### 🎯 Main Goals

1. **Identify and Monitor Trends:** The system identifies the most **frequent and relevant topics** within recent news data (filtered from 2020 onward) using advanced semantic clustering (K=5). These themes are **monitored over time** through a streaming flow analysis based on **non-overlapping tumbling windows**, with aggregated results printed in console using `outputMode("update")` for clear sequential interpretation.

2. **Enable Personalized Recommendations (via Graph):** A rich **Neo4j graph structure** was built to model relationships between users (simulated), news/topics (`headline` and `short_description`), their assigned cluster, and editorial categories. This structure **enables various types of personalized recommendations**, demonstrated via example Cypher queries (without implementing collaborative ML algorithms like ALS in Spark).

3. **Visualize Complex Relationships:** A **clear and interactive visual representation** (via Neo4j Browser) shows links between topics, categories, clusters, and simulated users, enabling intuitive data exploration.

## 📦 Dataset Used

* **Main Dataset:** [News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset)
    * `headline`: News title
    * `short_description`: Short text
    * `category`: Original category
    * `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)

* **Streaming Data (Simulated):** Kafka producer sends JSON messages like:
    ```json
    {"headline": "News Title 1", "category": "CATEGORY_NAME_1", "short_description": "Short description..."}
    {"headline": "News Title 2", "category": "CATEGORY_NAME_2", "short_description": "Another description..."}   
    ```

## 🛠️ Architecture Setup and Installation

The system is deployed on a 3-node VM cluster (Ubuntu 20.04):

- **master**: NameNode, ResourceManager, Kafka Broker, Neo4j, Spark driver
- **worker1**/**worker2**: DataNode, NodeManager, Spark workers

All installation details, network setup, SSH config, and setup scripts are explained in the original [README.md](README.md).

---

## 🧪 Data Preprocessing (Batch and Stream)

Key preprocessing steps include:

1. **Date Filtering:** Only records from 2020 onwards are considered (about 5500 entries).
2. **Category Grouping:** 42 original categories are manually grouped into 22 meaningful categories (e.g., `BUSINESS_FINANCE`, `GOOD_WEIRD_NEWS`, `OTHER`).
3. **Text Cleaning:** Headlines and descriptions are lowercased, URLs/numbers/punctuation cleaned. No min-length filter.

---

## ✨ Advanced ML Pipeline and Clustering (Batch and Stream)

1. **Sentence Embeddings:** 768-dim embeddings from `all-mpnet-base-v2` model.
2. **Conversion to VectorUDT:** Required for Spark ML compatibility.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Standardization via Z-score.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA to 40 components.
5. **Clustering:** KMeans with K=5, based on empirical tuning (Silhouette ≈ 0.13).
6. **Model Persistence:** Models trained in batch are saved to HDFS and reused in stream jobs.

---

## 📈 Trend Identification and Monitoring

- **Batch:** Trends identified by cluster size and category composition.
- **Streaming:** Tumbling windows via Spark Streaming print per-window topic counts by cluster ID, enabling trend detection over time.

## 🕸️ Neo4j Graph and Recommendation Enablement

- **Batch (graph_builder.py):** Loads CSVs into Neo4j.
- **Streaming (streaming_job.py):** Updates Neo4j live via connector.
- **Cypher Queries:** Used for personalized recommendations, trend exploration, and graph statistics.
